# FRC-2021
Team 2556 code for 2020 FRC game Infinite Recharge


All includes should be in the .h files. The only includes in .cpp files should be the .h file for the class. The only exception for this is robot.cpp to include classes that need to include robot.h.

The includes have also been ordered to make them more readable. The order is as follows:
1. Standard c++ includes (string, iostream, etc)
2. FRC library includes (SmartDashboard, Phoenix, etc)
3. Our includes, split up by type. (ex. Opmodes, subsystems, etc)
